    Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------

TetrisPhix is a simple Java Tetris clone written for a University
assignment. The game features some nice sprites and images, as well
as a hardcore game mode and the ability to save highscores.

To play, just unzip the file. For Windows, you should be able to
double click the file "TetrisPhix.jar" and play it. If not, double
click the file "tetris.bat". For Linux (and maybe Mac OS) you can
run the game from the terminal with "java -jar TetrisPhix.jar".

To get rid of the game, delete the TetrisPhix folder and the
TetrisPhix.dat file. The TetrisPhix.dat file is in your home
directory:
    Windows: C:\Users\<your-user>\TetrisPhix.dat
    Linux and Mac OS: /home/<your-user>/TetrisPhix.dat

License information and a disclaimer can be found on the top level
directory, under LICENSE.txt and DISCLAIMER.txt respectively.

    Gameplay
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Classic mode: classic Tetris game with normal rules and TGM
rotations (S, Z and I pieces only have 2 rotations instead of 4).

- Hardcore mode: Tetris game where you can only clear a line if all
the blocks filling that line are the same color (i.e. a line must be
filled entirely with only one color).

- Every line cleared grants 10 points.

- For every 10 lines that you clear, you will advance to the next
level.

- The speed at which the pieces fall increases every level and caps
at level 8.

- Every level has a different background image, up to level 10.

- When you lose the game, you can choose to enter your name to save
your highscore.

- Highscores only save if they are higher than the current lowest
high score (i.e. if the lowest score is 100, you need a score of 110
for it to be saved).
